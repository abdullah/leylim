#Component

Like other content builders Leylim provides a own components.
You can use this component which generated by us, like this;

Firstly create a new instance of Leylim

```javascript
 new Leylim({
    el: '#app',
    thumbnailPath: 'component-images-path',
  });
```

Then import component or link to script tag

```javascript
import components from 'leylim/dist/components';

 new Leylim({
    el: '#app',
    thumbnailPath: 'component-images-path',
    components
  });
```

Components are each list element in the center and right of the screen.
When you clicked on component list which right of the screen, then this component will convert as row object by Leylim.

Maybe you can want to use one or more components together, in this case you can import each component one by one

```javascript
// whoops they are fake component
import Lone from 'leylim/dist/components/Lone';
import Ltwo from 'leylim/dist/components/Ltwo';

 new Leylim({
    el: '#app',
    thumbnailPath: 'component-images-path',
    components: [Lone, Ltwo]
  });
```
