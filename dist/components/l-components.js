Killing Rhaegar at the Battle of the Trident, his climactic duel turned the tides of the war in his favor. After the war and following Lyanna\'s death, Robert married Cersei Lannister to cement an alliance with House Lannister to hold the kingdoms together, but the marriage was loveless.</p>\n\n        <p>Robert also had two younger brothers, Stannis and Renly. He and Cersei have three children: Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen. However, unbeknownst to Robert and most of the realm, all three were actually fathered by Cersei\'s twin brother, Jaime Lannister. On the other hand, Robert had many bastards from other women, including Gendry and Barra.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class="l-col" contenteditable>\n        <img src="https://www.ablogofthrones.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Robert-Baratheon-Kills-Rhaegar-Targaryen-FEAT.jpg"\n          />\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ',style:"\n    .l-one-column {\n        display: flex;\n        flex-flow: wrap;\n    }\n    .l-col {\n      width: 50%;\n    }\n    .l-col img {\n      max-width: 100%\n    }\n    "},{name:"l-two-column",thumbnail:"l-two.png",template:'\n  <div class="l-two-column">\n    <div class="l-col" contenteditable>\n      <h3>Title</h3>\n      <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.
